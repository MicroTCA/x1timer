                             The X1TIMER Linux device driver
                             
The DAMC device driver designed to provide access to the memmory and IO space of the X1TIMER, X2TIMER and NAMC-psTimer module.
As well to make DMA transfer from X1TIMER module to host memmory space.

Installation:
The driver file should be installed in the /lib/modules/`uname -r'/doocs directory.
(create this  directory: "sudo mkdir /lib/modules/`uname -r'/doocs" )

Creating udev rules (Ubuntu 8.x for other Linux versions read the udev manual):
1. add this line to the /etc/udev/permissions.rules:
# X1TIMER modules
SUBSYSTEM=="x1timer",      MODE="066" 

2.add lines to the /etc/udev/rules.d/60-symlinks.rules
    #rules to create damc device nodes
    KERNEL=="x1timers3",     SYMLINK="x1timer1"
    KERNEL=="x1timers1",     SYMLINK="x1timer2"
    KERNEL=="x1timers2",     SYMLINK="x1timer0"
 
For UBUNTU 10.x one has to craete the files 40-permissions.rules and 60-symlinks.rules in the /etc/udev/rules.d directory.

Call "depmod -a" and try to load the driver calling "modprobe x1timer"
To unload the driver call rmmod x1timer.

One can check the messages from the driver by calling "sudo tail -f /var/log/kern.log" 

The driver during loading creates the "x1timer" class in /sys/class and device nodes x1timersX in /dev 
directory. There X is a slot number in which the module is installed. To have standard device names 
(for example x1timer0 or x1timer1) one should create udev rules.
   
Using the driver:
The example code is x1timer_test.cpp.
